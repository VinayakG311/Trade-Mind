## ðŸ”‘ API Keys

To access stock data, you'll need to obtain an API key from a stock data provider (e.g., Alpha Vantage), and an API key for the Open Router LLM

1. **Create a `.env` File**:

   In the root directory, create a file named `.env` and add your API key:

   ```env
   ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY="DUI991O7XVBGTYVA"
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=""
   OPENROUTER_BASE   = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
   ```



2. **Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`**:

   To prevent accidental commits of sensitive information, ensure your `.gitignore` includes:

   ```gitignore
   .env
   ```
